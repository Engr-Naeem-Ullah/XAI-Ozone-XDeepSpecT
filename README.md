"A Novel Explainable Deep Learning Method Based on Spectral Co-Clustering for Ozone Time Series Forecasting."

The paper introduces a deep learning framework for time series forecasting, focusing on ozone concentration prediction. Our approach enhances both accuracy and interpretability using spectral co-clustering. We also introduce XDeepSpecT, a novel explainability method that helps reveal key temporal dependencies and feature relationships.
